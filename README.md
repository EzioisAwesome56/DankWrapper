# DankWrapper
Similar to Mojang's [LaunchWrapper](https://github.com/Mojang/LegacyLauncher) project, which is used to launch Minecraft 1.5.2 and below in the new launcher. Applies mostly the same patches to said versions
## Differences
Unlike the official Mojang solution, this works on Java 9 and above. Currently only tested on Release 1.5.2, but anything that doesnt use the Alpha or Beta Tweakers should work fine.
